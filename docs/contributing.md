# Contributing guidelines

Hi! Thanks for considering contributing to `b2piet` :smile:.
In order to make your contributing experience as frictionless as possible,
please follow the following guidelines.

### Ask for help!

If you are unsure about something or you don't understand something,
don't hesitate to ask questions on the issue tracker!
Surely, the code and documentation isn't perfect :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

You might also want to consult the different files in the `docs` folder which
describe the internals (c.f. [how does this work?](README.md/#does-this-work)).

### Follow the existing code style.

This applies to variables naming schemes, indentation, commit logs et cetera.
It also means that you should use British English.

Unless there are exceptional circumstancesâ„¢,
a line should not be longer than 79 characters.
This applies to both code and documentation.

### Do not leave trailing whitespace.

### Open an issue _before_ you start working on a pull request.

If you would like to submit a PR,
please open an issue discussing it before starting to work on the PR,
if one doesn't already exist.
If one does exit, do chime in with what you're planning to do.

Feel free to skip this if the PR is small (< 10 lines and only affects docs).

### Use the commit message's body to explain details.

Check the git logs to see roughly how detailed a commit message should be.

Feel free to skip this if the PR is small (< 10 lines and only affects docs).
