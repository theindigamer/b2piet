# Contributing guidelines

Hi! Thanks for considering contributing to `b2piet` :smile:.
In order to make your contributing experience as frictionless as possible,
please follow the following guidelines.

PR = Pull Request,
Trivial PR = PR that doesn't affect the code and edits less than 10 lines.

### Ask for help!

If you are unsure about something or you don't understand something,
don't hesitate to ask questions on the issue tracker!
Surely, our code and documentation isn't perfect :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

You might also want to consult the different files in the `docs` folder which
describe the internals (c.f. [how does this work?](README.md/#does-this-work)).

### Follow the existing code style.

This applies to variables naming schemes, indentation, commit logs et cetera.
It also means that you should use British English.

Unless there are exceptional circumstancesâ„¢,
a line should not be longer than 79 characters.
This applies to both code and documentation.

### Do not leave trailing whitespace at the end of a line.

### Open an issue _before_ submitting a non-trivial PR.

If you would like to submit a PR,
open an issue discussing it before starting to work on the PR,
if one doesn't already exist.
This step can be skipped for trivial PRs.

### Use a feature branch.

You can create a new branch and switch to it using `git checkout -b myfeature`.
This applies to both trivial and non-trivial PRs.

### Use the commit message's body to explain details for a non-trivial PR.

Check the git logs to see roughly how detailed a commit message should be.
For trivial PRs, it is okay to have no body for the commit message.
